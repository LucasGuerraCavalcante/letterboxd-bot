# letterboxd-bot

A simple web scrapping/automation based bot that I made to update my Letterboxd account, adding for me all movies I've watched in 2019/2020.

I used to write down every movie I've watched on a text file. Then a friend told me about Letterboxd, a realy cool social network that
"All members can rate films, review films and tag them with relevant keywords. They may also maintain lists of films they have watched or want to watch,
and interact with other members..." (Wikipedia)

Since checking all those movies in my text file, one by one, would take me a considerable amout of time, 
I've made this bot to do the hard work for me. 

It can read a .txt file, sign in on Letterboxd, search for all movies that are in the file and check then as watched. 

Just a print screen that I made during some test in my test account:
